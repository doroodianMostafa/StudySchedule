###Scheduleing project###

> [!NOTE]
- [ ] The whole project should be added to my GitHub Repo.

The idea is to keep my study data and later find applications for it. Possibilities are:
- Making an auto post calender respeting the input data.
- Making analysis of my study routines, and driving conclcusion to reflect on my study beahviour.
- ...

it can be done through multiple steps. Initial steps is going to be:
- [ ] Keep the track of study in this repo on a daily basis no matter if it's good or bad.
- [ ] Keep it as raw as possible in a text file, and later develop it to a python base app.
- [ ] The app can get inputs such as date, time, amount of pomodoros per day.
- [ ] Later it can be developed to cover subject of studies as well.
